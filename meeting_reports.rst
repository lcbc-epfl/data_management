Meeting about data management (24.01.2019)
------------------------------------------

People involved: 
****************

* Simon Dürr
* Daniele Narzi
* Mathias Dankl
* Pablo Baudin

Question discussed:
*******************

* What are the first steps we should take to improve data mangement at LCBC.

Decision taken:
***************

* Simon will ask Ursula to get the DMPs she has already written for grant proposals.

* Simon will create a github account for LCBC. This git repo should be used to store 
  all the scripts and software developped by LCBC members. The goal is to improve 
  sharing scripts and software to lab members but also to have something to reference 
  in publications. 

* Pablo is writing a document containing guidelines and references for data management. 
  This document should be available to everyone (put on gihub?) and can/should be 
  modified as we are confronted with concrete problems regarding DM.

* It has been suggested that a tool/script should be created to automatize the creation 
  of a folder structure for a new project. (For example: make new_project) answer a few 
  questions like name?, project name?, domain (bio, perovskites, methods)?... Which 
  then produces a starting point for the folder hierarchy (with README files?).

Next meeting: (31.01.2019 at 16.00)
***********************************

* We should each organize the data related to one of our project as we think it should 
  be done. With proper metadata and following the guidelines provided by EPFL.

* We should then discuss (the 4 of us) and find out if thinks are missing in our organizations.

* We will then talk to the other people in the subgroups to figure out if everyone agrees 
  with the file organization and naming conventions and eventually improve it.

* Based on those conclusion the LCBC data documentation should be updated.

The subgroups are as follows:
