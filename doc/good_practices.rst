Good practices
--------------

* **Use Open-Source as much as possible.** 
    
    For software and for data. A list of recommended file format can be found at 
    https://researchdata.epfl.ch under "TOOLS -> EPFL Recommended File Formats".

* **Organize and describe your data.**

    * Follow the recommended folder structure and use the README file templates
      to describe your data (see, :ref:`readme_templates`).
    * If you want to stick to your own way, it's ok, just make sure everything is clear and
      properly documented.
    * You are also very welcome to suggest modifications to our guidelines and
      template generator.

* **Publish your data.**

    * For example using zenodo_ or other data repositories. 
    * You can also use data journals like `The Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data`_.
    * Publish as much data as possible and organize it as described above.

* **Write Data Management Plans for your projects.** 

    This is particularly important when writing research project proposals. We provide several 
    templates and tools in the reference section to help you write a DMP.
