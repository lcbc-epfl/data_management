.. _lcbc_github:

The LCBC github organization
============================

We have created a github organization for LCBC. You can find it there:
https://github.com/lcbc-epfl.
This webpage can be used to store all the scripts and programs that we want to
share with each other or with the rest of the world.

It is also used to store this documentation (the ``data_management`` repository).

* In order to use it, you will first have to create a github account, https://github.com/.

* Then send your username and email address to either pablo.baudin@epfl.ch or simon.durr@epfl.ch.
  We will then add you to the LCBC organization and you will be able to create
  repositories or submit modifications to existing ones like this
  documentation.
