How to write and use README file to describe data and folder hierarchies
========================================================================

* Make a script that generates a template for README files.

* The script should take specific information and create the template
  accordingly.

Information to provide
----------------------

* Project title

* Name, institution, email,

* Subject:

    * Perovskites

    * Biochemistry

    * Method developement

    * Photo-chemistry


* Metadata type:
  
    * Project description: at the base of every file hierarchy, such a 
      global README file should be included.

    * Computation: This type README file should be included in each directory
      containing inputs and outputs from calculations or sets of calculations.
      Typically it should contain all the information necessary to reproduce
      the calculations (software versions, inputs, script, submission lines...)

    * Data collection: This type of README file should be included in each
      directory containing a collection of data (resulting from a set of
      calculations, from experiments, from published papers...)

    * Sub-directory: Just an intermediate directory in the file hierarchy.
