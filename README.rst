Research Data Management at LCBC
================================

This documentation has been written to help LCBC members with the management of
their data. It is available at
https://data-management.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Good practices
--------------

* **Use Open-Source as much as possible.** 
    
    For software and for data. A list of recommended file format can be found at 
    https://researchdata.epfl.ch under "TOOLS --> EPFL Recommended File Formats".

* **Organize and describe your data.**

    * Follow the recommended folder structure and naming conventions (to be added).
    * Describe your data extensively (e.g. using README files).

* **Publish your data.**

    For example using zenodo_ or other data repositories. You 
    can also use data journals like `The Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data`_
    Publish as much data as possible and organize it as described above.

* **Write Data Management Plans for your projects.** 

    This is particularly important when writing research project proposals. We provide several 
    templates and tools below to help you write a DMP.
